## ## Hi, I'm Mansi 👋

I'm a BTech CSE student actively working towards becoming a strong backend developer.  
I focus on learning by building — writing clean code, understanding core concepts, and improving a little every day.

This GitHub is my progress log: projects, experiments, and problem-solving as I prepare for internships and real-world development.
